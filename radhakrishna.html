                <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-2"><i>Krishna</i>&nbsp;is a name of the original, unique Supreme Person, the source of all existence. God has many names, and each describes a different aspect of His personality. Allah, Vishnu, Jehovah, and God refer to His greatness and His role as creator, maintainer of the universe, and Lord of all. The name Krishna—"the all-attractive one"—indicates the unequaled charm and beauty of the Supreme Person, as He appears to His most dear devotees.<br>
                  <br>Krishna appears as other forms of God—avatars—to create and maintain the universe, while He simultaneously enjoys loving&nbsp;relationships&nbsp;with His countless associates in the&nbsp;spiritual world. He visits this&nbsp;material world&nbsp;from time to time to free His devotees from material existence and to vanquish the wicked. He performs superhuman pastimes—lifting mountains, swallowing forest fires, and killing numerous extraordinarily powerful demons—as easily as a child playing with toys.<br>
                  <br><i>Radharani</i> is the feminine counterpart of Krishna. The highest truth has both male and female aspects. Like the sun and the sunshine, each gives meaning to the other. The male and female aspects of the Supreme Being appear together as&nbsp;Vishnu&nbsp;and Laksmi,&nbsp;Rama&nbsp;and Sita, and&nbsp;Krishna&nbsp;and Radharani.<br>
                  <br>Gaudiya Vaishnava theology includes an awareness of both the feminine and the masculine aspects of God’s personality. The divine counterpart of Sri Krishna is known as Sri Radha. Together, according to the ancient Vaishnava tradition, this dual-gendered divinity is God-male and female dimensions of the Absolute Truth. Sri Radha is the complete energy, and Sri Krishna is the complete energetic source. They are nondifferent from each other, just as musk and its scent are forever merged, or as fire and heat are inseparable.<br>

      <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-3"> Radha and Krishna are one, yet They have assumed two separate forms to enjoy loving pastimes. Numerous theological texts explain how this is so, but most thorough are the writings of Krishnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami and Rupa Gosvami, great masters in the Vaishnava tradition whose books have been translated and commented upon by His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. To understand Sri Radha, then, English readers would do well to turn to Srila Prabhupada’s books.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-size: 1.875rem; font-weight: 700;">Krishna</span>
        <br>Krishna talks about Himself in the&nbsp;Bhagavad-gita, explaining how anyone can know Him through&nbsp;Krishna consciousness, bhakti-yoga. The&nbsp;Srimad-Bhagavatam&nbsp;further describes Krishna's uncommon and fascinating personality and activities in its&nbsp;Tenth Canto.<br>
        <br>Krishna is the source of&nbsp;<i>brahman</i>, the all-pervading spiritual energy which includes everything and everyone. We are all one with Krishna, in the sense that we are all parts of the supreme whole. He is also present in every atom, as well as in the hearts of all living things as&nbsp;<i>Paramatma</i>, the Supersoul. But ultimately, Krishna is&nbsp;<i>Bhagavan</i>, the Supreme Person who possesses all opulences—wealth, strength, fame, knowledge, beauty, and detachment—to the fullest degree.<br>
        <br>Realization of Krishna progresses in three stages; first comes an understanding of His all-pervading&nbsp;<i>brahman</i>&nbsp;feature, then one realizes His presence within one's self and others as&nbsp;<i>Paramatma</i>, and finally one comes to appreciate Krishna as He is, as&nbsp;<i>Bhagavan</i>, the all-attractive Supreme Person, the ultimate cause of all causes, the source of all of us and of being itself.<br>
        <br>Krishna always appears as a fresh youth with a dark complexion, surrounded by loving devotees, decorated with garlands of flowers and peacock feathers in His curling, bluish-black hair. He plays as a cowherd boy in the rural setting of&nbsp;Vrindavan, along with countless other cowherd boys,&nbsp;<i>gopas</i>, and cowherd girls,&nbsp;<i>gopis</i>. In His pastimes as a small child, He captivates the minds of the residents of Vrindavan with His charming, naughty behavior, such as stealing butter. In His youth, He captures the hearts of the&nbsp;<i>gopis</i>&nbsp;by His irresistible beauty, charm, and flute playing.<br>
        <br>The greatest personalities of ancient times, such as Narada, Asita, Devala, Vyasadeva—who compiled the&nbsp;Vedas—and Arjuna, to whom Krishna spoke the Bhagavad-gita, all accept Krishna to be the Supreme Person, the&nbsp;Absolute Truth, the ultimate source of all energies, and the One ultimately responsible for the creation, maintenance, and annihilation of everything in the material world.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-size: 1.875rem; font-weight: 700;">Radha</span>
        <br>Historically, the ancient&nbsp;Puranas&nbsp;reveal much about Sri Radharani, even if the&nbsp;Srimad-Bhagavatam&nbsp;(10.30.28), the cream of all such&nbsp;puranic&nbsp;literature, mentions Her name only once-with the indirect&nbsp;anayaradhitah, indicating that She is “the one who worships Krishna best.” Both the&nbsp;Padma Purana&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Brahma-vaivarta Purana, on the other hand, elaborate on Her pastimes of love with Krishna and reveal how the divine couple is the source of all that is. The&nbsp;Brahma-vaivarta Purana, in fact, reveals an esoteric creation story in which Radha co-creates the material world with Krishna.<br>
        <br>In short, the theology of Sri Radha is deep. The scriptures describe that one must go through many lives of pious acts, religious rituals, and yogic perfection before attaining the mercy of Sri Radha. And when one does, Krishna is not far off. In fact, it is through Sri Radha’s mercy that Krishna becomes attainable.<br>
        <br>Radha is Krishna’s mercy incarnation, and through Her one can attain the culmination of the spiritual pursuit. Srila Prabhupada sums this up as follows:<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 1rem;">"Radharani, You are so dear to Krishna. So we offer our respectful obeisances unto You.” Radharani is&nbsp;hari-priya: “very dear to Krishna.” Through the mercy of Radharani we can easily approach Krishna. If Radharani recommends, “This devotee is very nice,” then Krishna immediately accepts me, however great a fool I may be. Because I am recommended by Radharani, Krishna accepts me. Therefore in Vrindavana you’ll find all the devotees chanting Radharani’s name more than Krishna’s. Wherever you’ll go, you’ll find the devotees greeting one another, “Jaya Radhe!” You’ll find this still in Vrindavana. The devotees are glorifying Radharani.<br>
          <br>If you go by the speculative process to understand Krishna, it will take many, many lives. But if you take to devotional service and just try to please Radharani, Krishna will be gotten very easily. Radharani can deliver Krishna. She is so great a devotee, the emblem of&nbsp;maha-bhagavata. Even Krishna cannot understand the quality of Radharani’s devotion. Although Krishna says&nbsp;vedaham samatitani-“I know everything”-He fails to understand Radharani. She is so great.
        </span>
        <br>
        <br>It is in pursuit of these truths that Radha and Krishna descend as Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, for in that form They taste the highest mercy and bestow it on others. The chief manifestation of that mercy is the holy name in the form of the&nbsp;maha-mantra: Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.<br>
        <br>In this mantra both Radha and Krishna are fully manifest. A prayer to Sri Radha (Hare&nbsp;is the vocative form of&nbsp;Hara, another name for Radharani), it beseeches Krishna to be engaged in devotional service, the highest form of yoga. Radha is the medium through which such service is enacted, for She is the embodiment of devotion, the essence of love for Krishna.<br>
